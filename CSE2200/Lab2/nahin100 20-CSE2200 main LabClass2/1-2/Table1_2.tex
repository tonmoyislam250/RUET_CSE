LaTeX is a macro package for typesetting documents. It
is a language-based approach, where LaTeX instructions
are interspersed with the text file of a document, say
myfile.tex, for obtaining the desired output as
myfile.dvi. The myfile.dvi file can then be used to
generate myfile.ps or myfile file.
